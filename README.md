# library
By focusing on Javascript's DOM Manipulation and Function capabilities I create a library app and honed essential javascript skills




# Notes
To safeguard against potential security risks, avoided using innerHTML to create individual book cards, and opted to create and append each individual title, author, pages, read status element to card element.




.Library
Will create a CSS Grid to display the individual book cards

## Adding new book
Will use a dialog to open when new book button is clicked
